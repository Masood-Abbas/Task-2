This drive led him to the UK, where he pursued a law degree and was called to the Bar at the prestigious Lincoln's Inn in London.</span>

                      cities of Lahore and Karachi.<span class="more-read">But it was in 2007, when he moved to Dubai, that his journey truly took a transformative turn. Joining one of the most prominent law firms in the Middle East, Tariq found success in his legal career, but something inside him craved more.</span>

                      practicing law—it was in creating.<span class="more-read">something enduring, something that would empower others to achieve greatness.</br></br>
                        This realization marked the beginning of an extraordinary shift. Transitioning from law to entrepreneurship isn’t easy, but Tariq was determined to make it happen. He took a leap of faith and founded his own law firm, Legal Inz, followed by InZone. But these ventures were more than just businesses—they were platforms designed to create success stories. Leveraging his legal expertise and the diverse experiences he had gathered along the way, Tariq built InZone Group with a singular vision: to help others succeed.</br></br>
                        Under his leadership, InZone has seen rapid growth, with ambitious plans for further expansion and a future IPO. Yet, for Tariq, it’s not just about the numbers—it’s about the lives he touches and the impact he makes.</span>
